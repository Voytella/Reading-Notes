# Calvin Coolidge Autobiography

### Coolidge, Calvin, et al. The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge. ISI Books, 2021. 

NOTE: I only decided to start taking notes in the middle of this book, so some
good stuff is missing from the beginning. I'll likely reread this one later, so
I'll revisit these notes then.

* “If the Senate has any weakness it is because the people have sent to that
  body men lacking the necessary ability and character to perform the proper
  functions. But this is not the fault of the Senate. It cannot choose its own
  members but has to work with what is sent to it. The fault lies back in the
  citizenship of the states. If the Senate does not function properly the blame
  is chiefly on them.” (p 105)
  
* Footnote: “Shortly after becoming president, Coolidge remarked, ‘I believe I
  can swing it.’” (p 112)
  
* “It would be exceedingly easy to set the country all by the ears and foment
  hatreds and jealousies, which, by destroying faith and confidence, would help
  nobody and harm everybody. The end would be the destruction of all progress.”
  (p 120)
  
* “The only way I know to drive out evil from the country is by the constructive
  method of filling it with good.” (p 120)

* “There is only one form of political strategy in which I have any confidence,
  and that is to try to do the right thing and sometimes be able to succeed.” (p
  123)
  
* “In the discharge of the duties of the office there is one rule of action more
  important than all others. It consists in never doing anything that some one
  else can do for you.” (p 127) Delegation!
  
* “In his [Jefferson’s] theory that the people should manage their government,
  and not be managed by it, he was everlastingly right.” (p 139)
  
* “There is no justification for public interference with purely private
  concerns.” (p 176)
  
* “The best help that benevolence and philanthropy can give is that which
  induces everybody to help himself.” (p 187)
  
* “Conditions must be provided under which people can make a living and work out
  of their difficulties.” (p 195)
  
* “There is no salvation in a narrow and bigoted partisanship.” (p 196)

* “The very stability of our society rests upon production and conservation. For
  individuals or for governments to waste and squander their resources is to
  deny these rights and disregard these obligations. _The result of economic
  dissipation to a nation is always moral decay._” (p 199-200) (emphasis mine)
  
* “There is little defense which can be made of a system which puts some men in
  the ranks on a very small pay and leaves others undisturbed to reap very large
  profits.” (p 209-210)
  
* “By tolerance I do not mean indifference to evil. I mean respect for different
  kinds of good.” (p 214)
